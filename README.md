# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining softwares.
The importance of software engineering includes ensuring the quality and reliability of software products by increasing their performance and security standards. It also enables scalability, cost-efficiency and innovative advancement for organizations by widening their client base and market.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering - This event recognized software development as an engineering discipline that needs to be improved upon to address future software crisis.
2. The Development of structured programming in the 1970s - These era introduced principles such as modular design and code reusability that improved the quality, efficiency and maintainability of softwares.
3. The rise of AGILE Methodologies - The Agile Manifesto shifted software development from rigid document-heavy processes to flexible, iterative development that is focused on collaboration and customer feedback.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning - Defines the project scope, objectives and feasibility
2. Requirement Analysis - Gathering and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements
3. Design- Creating system architecture and software design specifications
4. Implementation(Coding) - Writing and integrating code based on design specifications
5. Testing - Validating software performance, functionality and security.
6. Deployment - Releasing the finished product to users
7. Maintenance and Support - Fixing bugs, improving performance and updating features
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall uses a sequential linear process that is rigid with heavy documentation to deliver the final product at the end while Agile uses an iterative, incremental process that is highly adaptable with lightweight documentation with a focus on functional software and delivers the final product/features in sprints.
Waterfall can be used to design and develop systems that require strict compliance and detailed documentation like a banking system while Agile can be used to build softwares that require rapid iterations and depend on customer feedback like mobile apps with evolving user requirements



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
